Drone Cable‑Passing Hook System
A lightweight, RF‑controlled drone mechanism for safely passing, positioning, and releasing cables with precision.

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing, building, and testing a functional drone hook system capable of passing and positioning cables using a pulley‑based lifting mechanism and remote RF control.
The system is engineered to operate safely during aerial deployment, enabling precise cable placement in predefined locations.

🎯 Main Objectives
Design a lightweight mechanical hook optimized for holding and releasing cables.

Implement a pulley system to control the vertical movement of the hook.

Ensure precise cable placement in predefined or hard‑to‑reach locations.

Select and integrate a motor and electronic control system suitable for aerial operation.

Develop a wireless RF control system for real‑time hook actuation.

Program safety features to prevent accidental cable release.

Test the system in simulated cable‑passing scenarios.

Evaluate performance in terms of precision, stability, and reliability.
